# IP Address Lookup

This script allows you to look up information about a given IP address using the ip-api.com API. It retrieves details such as country, region, city, zip code, timezone, ISP, organization, and ASN.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install requests tabulate termcolor
2. Run the script and provide the IP address you want to lookup when prompted. If you don't provide an IP address, it will default to your current IP address.
   ```bash
   python ip_lookup.py
